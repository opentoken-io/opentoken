Style Guide
===========

This is a fairly comprehensive style guide.  It has been broken up into language-specific sections and general-purpose guides.  The purpose of a style guide is to make all of the code look the same.  This lets developers see and instantly recognize code more easily.  It helps put emphasis on problems before they grow into unmanageable monsters.  Standards are followed and the code is typically more robust.


Goals
-----

Most of the style guide is based around these goals:

* Write maintainable code
    * Prefer clean and straightforward instead of complicated, "clever" or tricky programming.
    * Use a consistent writing style so all of the code looks the same.
* The software is tested correctly
    * Module systems will easily allow for near 100% code coverage.
    * Tests reflect how the code behaves instead of the individual actions that are performed.
* The programmers can grow and become better.
    * We share ideas and learn from each other's experience.
    * The codebase will automatically be improved because the developers are improving.

All of these are discussed in depth in the [Style Guide Goals](style-guide-goals.md).
